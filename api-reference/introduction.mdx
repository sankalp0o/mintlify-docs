### Creating an account

Before you proceed, get your account created at [finigami.com/sign-up](https://www.finigami.com/sign-up). You will need an account to get an API key.



### API Key

Once you're signed in, get your API key from [Settings](https://www.finigami.com/settings). All API keys come with an expiration date for security that you can set. Once an API key expires, you'd need to generate a new one.
